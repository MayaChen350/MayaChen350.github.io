                    Welcome to my personal page! I’m an autistic nerdy girl
                    who’s hyperfixated about programming, music, some video
                    games and Toby Fox (my idol fr).I like embedded systems &lt3
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m from Canada, Québec and I really like electronic rock.
                    You don’t know electronic rock? Well it’s funny, In 2022
                    when Metal Gear Rising Revengeance became popular again I
                    really liked the soundtrack. But there’s a song that really
                    was giving me goosebumps everytime. Since i’m a kid I always
                    liked electronic music and I loved dubstep for the 2-3 years
                    it lasted,. I was really surprised when I discovered “Stains
                    of time”, AKA Monsoon’s battle theme. Not only it was making
                    the battle even more epic this entire song was a banger and
                    it was making me shake from the inside how much i loved that
                    song it fitted my weird tastes at 100%, I really wanted to
                    find other songs like it but failed for a while. I then gave
                    up thinking there was not anything else like it ever. In
                    November 2023, I had found a spotify playlist rocktronic,
                    and I fell on a song by Celldweller called “Electric Eye”. I
                    was so confused about how good it was. I could not believe
                    my ears, I went listen to other of his songs and I found
                    really hard to realize: I loved so much of his songs.
                    Celldweller became my source of happiness of goosebumps and
                    all for months and it really made me discover what really is
                    Electronic Rock. The song “End of an empire” is a really
                    good exemple. It’s long but worth it, Celldweller’s 2nd
                    album is my favorite btw. Also if you want different
                    electronic “rock” I really recommend “The path of totality”
                    by Korn. Really good album that I had never discovered
                    before somehow. Even Skrillex made GOOD songs with them.
                    It’s really insane. I hope you’ll like it,
                </p>
