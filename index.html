                        <p>
                            Welcome to my personal page! I’m an autistic nerdy
                            girl who’s hyperfixated about programming, music,
                            some video games and Toby Fox (my idol fr).I like
                            embedded systems &lt3
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’m from Canada, Québec and I really like electronic
                            rock. You don’t know electronic rock? Well it’s
                            funny, In 2022 when Metal Gear Rising Revengeance
                            became popular again I really liked the soundtrack.
                            But there’s a song that really was giving me
                            goosebumps everytime. Since i’m a kid I always liked
                            electronic music and I loved dubstep for the 2-3
                            years it lasted,. I was really surprised when I
                            discovered “Stains of time”, AKA Monsoon’s battle
                            theme. Not only it was making the battle even more
                            epic this entire song was a banger and it was making
                            me shake from the inside how much i loved that song
                            it fitted my weird tastes at 100%, I really wanted
                            to find other songs like it but failed for a while.
                            I then gave up thinking there was not anything else
                            like it ever. In November 2023, I had found a
                            spotify playlist rocktronic, and I fell on a song by
                            Celldweller called “Electric Eye”. I was so confused
                            about how good it was. I could not believe my ears,
                            I went listen to other of his songs and I found
                            really hard to realize: I loved so much of his
                            songs. Celldweller became my source of happiness of
                            goosebumps and all for months and it really made me
                            discover what really is Electronic Rock. The song
                            “End of an empire” is a really good exemple. It’s
                            long but worth it, Celldweller’s 2nd album is my
                            favorite btw. Also if you want different electronic
                            “rock” I really recommend “The path of totality” by
                            Korn. Really good album that I had never discovered
                            before somehow. Even Skrillex made GOOD songs with
                            them. It’s really insane. I hope you’ll like it,
                        </p>
