Wandering under the shadow of the sun
Lost, forgotten and abandoned
In the mirror I see no reflection

The steps of my efforts erased
No one could tell they have ever been there
The desert leaves no traces

My two feet in cold water
I wonder what I should look at
But anyway I’m getting deep underwater
///
I regret so much
I hate everything
I want to get rid of everything
I want to pass time with everyone
Life or death will never do the job
I’m prisoner of my own pain
Life is just a desert with a water source just getting further and further
At the end the desert drains you and you get mad
///
I’m floating in the void between boredom and numbness
Everything is just cold… And ice
What am I supposed to find here?
The path is unclear…
Nothing’s clear anymore

Before everything froze
I was waving on the seas of life
None knows where those waves will lead them

Only can you be pleased by the lights of the sun
Or can you be feared by the shines of the moon

Unless everything freeze, that is
///
Burn in a pillar of flames
The flames of your indecision
The flames of your lies
The flames of your unsaid and undone
And since you are blazed
Can you see them anymore?
Your true feelings?
///
Do you think I’m dancing?
What do you think I’m doing?

From here you should be seeing
That I’m not doing what you’re doing
When you are skating
I find myself falling

But look at me! I’m fine!

I wonder sometimes
If sometimes I should place things at their « right » places
Instead of living in dust
But things are perfectly placed… Where they shouldn’t be placed
Then does that makes them their « right » places?
If yes that would make me lost

I’m walking outside the same way, same route, same directions, same time
Go there, go where? Not there, go where?
Do what? Do this, do that
Do those things because the other guy in front of you did the same thing

No!
I don’t want to!
What if I say no?
No I have to so
I won’t miss the next bateau

But why is it that way?
Anyway I shouldn’t care
As I can’t change this anyway

I’m so happy that through my tower
I can see all those lovers
For who they get all the luck

But so should I be happy
As I’m still very lucky :
To be alive is a stroke of luck!

I passed through a lot already
I say that pain is my bestie
As we know eachother too much
And we hate eachother so much

There are walls everywhere
They’re watching me from everywhere
But for me I feel that I’m the middle of nowhere

Just how many impossibilities will I have to achieve?
So I could get what I cannot acquire?
///
Isolated on the unsupportable
I’m waving my hand at the wind
The cold wind of my grind

Able to do something
But in the end have done nothing
But I can’t do anything else than keep on smiling
///
Things used to go forward
Faster, and faster
And then slower, and slower
Things cannot go backward

And slower, slower
It’s hard to notice there was a day anymore
And slower, slower (2x)
Light, is there no more?

Freeze
No more things
I’m no more advancing

Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Has everyone forgotten about me?
Already?

Dark, yet darker
I walk, or do I?
Scarier, yet scarier
I’m crying, am I?

The silence
The total darkness
The feeling of being watched
Even if there is no one else

I failed
I did failed
I think I did failed?

I want to feel again
I AM BLEEDING FROM THE INSIDE
I don’t think I can say : « not again »
I AM BURNING FROM EVERY SIDES

Why…?
Why why?
Why why?!
WHY WHY?!

Everything I’ve seen
Everything I’ve done
Everything I’ve sacrificed
For finally sacrificing myself
For all I have undone

At the non-asking of the void
My final destination
///
Why are you even opening the lights?
That’s not how I feel

Don’t try to look at me
I have nothing for you

You can’t see me
You’re hiding me from you

You are alone
Do you see someone else in the dark?
///
If you have something you can enjoy
While I can’t even find the time to lend joy,
My tears covering the ground
Then why are you walking between my wounds?
You thought I would be warm but I am everything but warm

You left me
J’ai laissé ma vie
I hurt you
Mais tu étais déjà finie de nous

Life isn’t what it used to be
You can look at far at you can
Run as far as you can
It will have still be

And it will not
Be the same again
And we will not
Be the same again
And it will not
Be summer again

For us
As snow is falling to cover us
At the beginning of Spring
///
Facing the ground, screaming
In my hands the same knife everyone was pointing me with

"We hate you"
"Why don't you get away?"

If I stand up no one's gonna look at me
My ridiculous face
My ridiculous body
My ridiculous mind
As I can't even stand up I'm just someone to laugh at

If some voices are calling for me, I can't hear them
If they knew I would just scare them
The knife draining my life would then be lend to them

I'm just a nuisance
Someone to complain about
As nobody understands me they'll prefer to scream at me
But I'm not someone to scream about

I wish they would just kill me

But my words are just words
And my texts are just meaningless
As all I do is pointless, useless

The knife passing through my life
I'm trying to find a way for it to be painless
So as I'm listening to the voices in my head
I try to disappear for that I can accept my pain

"Don't think"
"Stop thinking"
"Nothing's gonna be fine"
"You're not worth thinking"
"Just sink"

"But don't drown"
///
The sky is gray and I don't know if the stars stares at me
I will cry when they'll say that their lights are on me

In my head a fog
In my body no energy
I want to reach my hands to the stars that are long lost

Just please shine for me please
I had enough I'm not so tough
Enlight me with your light, enlight me with your life

I don't want to believe I'm hurt anymore
Even if I don't feel you around
I know that far ahead I matter more
And then I'll stop doing rounds
///
Nobody will see you
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
Nobody will see you

Nobody will care
Whatever you feel
Whatever you felt
Nobody will care

Will I do it
Will I give up

What's on the road?
I don't know
Still a long way to go

I can't see it
I can't see it
I can hardly see it

The bliss, the joy, the happiness of my world
The curse of this world, with no one around

Hope
Is there any?
For me?
Someone like me
can deserves any?

I fall I advance
I fall I advance
I trip I stand up
I fall

I fall
I fall
I sink...
I drown...
///
If only you knew
Than in another world, in another reality
I would have burn my hands for you

But now my hands are far
Far from reach, far, far
Who should hold unto them?
///
It's the end
It still amazes me that at the beginning
We were friends

But you threw me away
Why? Was I really that bad?
This is just so sad

The painful memories of a beautiful past
Haunting me, from how much I crashed
Trying so hard to stay on my raft

Your face won't go off my mind
You'll always be in my mind
No matter how hard you try me to not be in yours

I'll always remember you
No matter how far l'll have to look back
I'll always do
///
The deep plains of dread darken my head
The painful memories of living
As empty as I can be seeing

The uncomfortable feeling of comfort
The silence scolding me inside
A strange feeling of

Remove me my mask
Drown me into uncomfort
Give me what I lack

Take my soul away
Put your hand deep within
And take my light away

I can't think, feel or see
I can't bleed, fight or flee
Put me to sleep for my eternity
///
I can only see fire
The darkness flashes in my eyes
And the lightness darken into lies

When I'm not about to burst
I descend into madness
When I ascend the anger

Too pissed off to calm down
Too pissed off to break down
Too pissed off to know when to stop

In my head, in my hands, in my eyes I see fire
The fire burns
The fire will burn
///
Truth! You're a monster
Why don't you get away from me?
You scare me
And you scare the others

Why are you so ugly to my eyes
From far away you frighten me
When close I close my eyes
Only sometimes can you be pretty?

Stop touching my friends
Stop touching my future
Please, lemme stop seeing you
Others call you anxiety, but I prefer when I don't have to call you true

Lemme dive into the water
Stop watching me from there
I won't drown if you're not there
Just let me test the water

Only once
///
Stuck into hell
The voices are calling me
Stuck into hell
The words are hurting me

A terrible feeling
Unhappy living
A sheet to my death
An entrance to my despair

The cage is getting flooded
And by then in pain I would
My eyes have become black
And I lack the will to live
///
It is cold tonight

Leaves, fall

Wind, blows

They leave

They leave you
///
From so far I knew it
I was looking at it

This shadow, as it drew closer to me
It'll push me in sorrow, like it has to be

I may have shined for others
But I won't shine for another

I take a hand to touch the ground
But there's nowhere good to take a step

I grab the barreaux of my prison bare handed
Aren't they still soft in my hands?

I desired love, I desired friends
But I wanted peace, I wanted peace

Rain can fall for the loss of others
Clouds can get out for the peace of oneself
///
I stole happiness from its locker

For once can I enjoy myself be selfish
Feelings stolen from my heart, I wished
They'll come back to me someday

Is it stealing to steal the steal of my feelings
The ones I've been wishing
They'll come back to me one day

But the knives are pointing from everywhere
They'll want them back from where they were
They never belonged to me anyway
///
A child who we did not love
Seeks love everywhere

When it's cold a hand will reach for them
A warm, soft hand will heal them

But when this hand is cold
Trying, the child will reach it
Their cold, trembling hand will approach it

And the child will realize
That they cannot help but be helped

A silent and uncomfortable feeling
The warm hand, getting colder
Leaving the child behind
The hand could not be helped

The voices are loud
They're tracking me
Piercing me

I can't move
Not a single step
I can't step out of the traps

The voices are loud
I'm doubting myself
I'm piercing myself

I can't move
Can't leave them behind
Can't leave me behind

The voices
Whenever
Wherever

I can't go
Nowhere to go
I have no legs

Vision goes dark
Everything becomes black
The oceans becomes ice
The nature dies around me

I can't see my hands
I can't feel my friends
I can't believe anymore

A frozen ship
How did it even happen
However it looks so normal to my eyes

The iceberg will never melt
The sun will never be hot enough
I'll be alone

Frozen
Again
And again

I let the water flow for a loved one
But the water was cold
Very cold

And now my friend is frozen
It doesn't matter if I tried to do any good
The seasons have lasted

And now alone
I dive my feet in the water
To join the frozen one

It's so lonely there,
With me around

Look everywhere around, so blurry
I listen to the sound, in silence

The feelings, so empty
They are talking, in silence

My eyes, so shiny

Did you ever see a microwave?
No way you have never seen one

Electromagnetic waves?

Electromagnetic microwaves?
Where am I even going with that

The C language!
Now I hope you C (see) it

Into the C language

Like a disease
Realizing my own mortality
Doesn't put me at ease

Take my hand and caress it
Tell me that this is not it
Yet, that this is not it yet

Can you share me yours?
You're so beautiful

My garden is crumbling
I just wanted the chance to bloom
But the sun started darkening
Am I going to wither?

Please don't abandon me the image of more peaceful days

As even if I end up falling in your arms
I still want you to be happy

You don't know what's on the other side of the river

You always wished to disappear
Get to the other side
Never come back to this side

It's not the first time you hallucinate a bridge
That one might end up being fake too

After all
You've been waiting, suffering, daydreaming for it ever so far
Can you even really believe anymore?

Maybe you'll never reach the other side
Maybe you're gonna starve here
Maybe you'll never reach a happy end

Perfectly imperfect
The division of logic and emotions
Disruptive and imperfect

I wonder what I did last evening
Did I get less than second to some social meaning?
Probably isn't of my business at all

Right, I shouldn't bother
Right now, what should I do for dinner?

Look at me

The roots of a heart
Darkened by failures
With no actual form of art

An identity
Built upon fidelity and infidelity
With no commodities

An artifact
Which we cannot tell the price
With never any bidder

I am just trapped

I might be starving
After all to eat I have nothing

I'm only dreaming

If I could get out of here
Maybe I'll get happy out of here

I always lie
Never cry
Never die

What the fuck am I doing
Let me live
Let me live
Let me live
Let me live
Let me live
Let me...

A quiet town
It's raining

Yet the ground so wet, all of them sound dry

This place
I've been there before

But last time I was there
It didn't look so sad

You can remove me everything

Still, there was never anything to begin with

The one we hurt
The one we throw away

One is standing right where it is

I saw two shadows this week

One was almost indiscernible
The other one was invisible

Mine was fading away

Voices don't exist

Ethereal punishment for those who never knew Heaven

Filling your eyes of my monstrosity
