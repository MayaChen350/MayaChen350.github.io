## Build

To build the website, if your system allows it, runs `make`.

Otherwise, do those steps:

1. Run `python` on `scripts/getJsonPoems.py` and `scripts/getNumerals.py`
2. Run `python` on `scripts/getJsonPoems.py` and `scripts/getJsonPoems.py`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run build` if you want the static webpage or `npm run dev`
